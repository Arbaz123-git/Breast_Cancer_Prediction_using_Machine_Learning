STEP FOLLOWED TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT WRITTEN IN SHORT (if you want to understand it properly visit predictions.ipynb file )

1. Data Acquisition : gathering relevant data for this problem.

2. Data Cleaning : Checking all data is available or not. If irrelevant data is there or mistakes are there in dataset then fill it with the appropriate one by domain knowledge or by Subject Matter Experts .Converting categorical variables into numerical variables.
   
3. Splitting Data : Dividing dataset into Training and test data.
   
4. Data Preprocessing : Scaling the data in uniform range so that it doesn't get baised on one of the column.
   
5. Model Building : Build the model and training the model with the training labelled data
   
6. Testing : Evaluating that the model is working accurately or not on Testing data by metrics such as confusion metrics, recall, precision, f1-score, and accuracy.
